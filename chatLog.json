Then they disappear.  </p><p>Ours is a good, solid German house, made of brick. But we live out in the country, and out in the country one has to deal with critters and creepy-crawly things. The doors and windows are tight, but there is obviously a crack in the outside wall to the kitchen. Every spring the ants wake up, get hungry, come inside the wall, and then maybe behind the cabinets, and find an entry to the kitchen.</p><p>Every year they find a <i>new</i>&nbsp;entry. I've heard that ants have collective intelligence, and that it's probably passed down from generation to generation. They are probably more intelligent than we, since every year we forget that the ants are coming. And then it takes us several days to find their point of entry.</p><p>Since we can't think like ants, we have to wait until a whole bunch of them have come in so we can see their trail. Then we get out the ant spray, secure the entry, and wait a few days see if they find a new entry and come back.</p><p>They usually don't. The spring weather gets warmer, and I presume the ants then find it easier to find their food outside rather than risk encountering ant spray inside. But they have the knowledge of how to get into our kitchen, and their offspring will use that knowledge next year, to find a new entry.</p><p>Here is this year's point of entry, and our weapon of choice. We're planning on renovating our kitchen this year. Maybe we'll find that crack in the wall and get it patched.</p>",

My 16 years of blogging are now saved as text files which Jekyll renders into static HTML, which I then push to GitHub where the blog is now hosted. I <a href=\"http://www.papascott.de/archives/2015/04/30/see-what-sticks/\">mentioned then</a> that I took Jekyll some 3 minutes to render my 3000 or so blog posts, which is kind of a drag since the default is to rebuild the entire site every time even a small change is made.&nbsp;</p><p>Actually, the latest version of Jekyll improved build times considerably. It can now build my 3000 pages in about a minute. But when making changes, that's still too long to wait.</p><p>However, using a trick, I can now build those 3000 pages in 4 seconds. The trick seems pretty obvious to me, but I've not seen it written up anyplace, so hence this post.</p><p>The trick, of course, is to <i>not</i> build all 3000 pages. For older posts use <a href=\"https://jquery.com/\">jquery</a> to load in parts of the layout that might change, but leave the HTML file alone. For me, those parts are the sidebar and the recent posts. I build HTML snippets for those divs and load them in like:</p><blockquote>$( \"#sidebar\" ).load( \"/includes/sidebar.html\" );</blockquote><p>Right now, on the Jekyll side I don't want it to rebuild posts from before 2015. I've put all those ins a _posts/older subdirectory and added an exclude: directive in my _config.yml:</p><blockquote>exclude: [_posts/older]</blockquote><p>On the HTML side, ever since I started blogging, even way-back-when with <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/12/08/editthispagecom.html\">EditThisPage</a>, my posts have been sorted by date. I need to tell Jekyll not to erase the pages I've chosen not to rebuild (and it's too bad _config.yml doesn't understand wild cards)</p><blockquote>keep_files: [archives/1999, archives/200, archives/2010, archives/2011, archives/2012, archives/2013, archives/2014 ]</blockquote><p>At least \"archives/200\" covers an entire decade in one entry. :smile:</p><p>And that's it. When I do want to rebuild to entire site, I can comment out those two directives and let 'er rip. And being hosted at GitHub, you can see all my gory source files in the source branch at <a href=\"https://github.com/papascott/papascott.github.io\">https://github.com/papascott/papascott.github.io</a></p>",

Being a server guy I of course installed my own (on a cheap 3,50€/mo VPS), and used it to write my last few blog posts.&nbsp;</p><p>I like it because because it's simple. And simple. Simple to write with, simple to work with.</p><p>It's simple to write with. You just open the editor page and type. To update your text, you just click on it and type. There are some simple formatting options, but nothing that gets in the way. When you update, though WebSocket magic anyone reading your post immediately gets the update.</p><p>And on the server it's <a href=\"http://my.1999.io/users/1999io/2016/04/11/0004.html\">simple to work with</a>. There's no database, just files in open formats readable as text, JSON, OPML, RSS, HTML. Formats you can use for other purposes if you are so inclined. Even the HTML files for each post contain the JSON for the post, which I first thought was redundant but now see is brilliant. It's like the web page contains it's own DNA and can re-create itself.&nbsp;</p><p>These open formats allow one to do things with the output that go beyond the server. For instance, I copy the output of my server to an S3 bucket at <a href=\"http://1999.papascott.de\">1999.papascott.de</a>, which can probably handle the load better than my cheap VPS. :smile: It’s not yet coupled to <a href=\"https://www.papascott.de/\">my main blog</a> on Jekyll (right now I’m using copy and paste), but I imagine it wouldn’t too much cleverness to achieve that.</p><p>I hope someday to be able to use <a href=\"http://1999.io\"><span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"http://1999.io\">1999.io</span></a> as a blogging central, with the ability to send my posts to my blog, or Twitter, or Facebook, or Medium, or wherever, but keeping my original posts for myself.

However, our lawyer was lazy, or slow, or something, and for our start of business the registration of the GmbH had not yet been approved by the local court. No registration, no firm, no business loan could be paid out. With a 7-figure purchase price due that day.</p><p>No problem, says the bank, we'll book the purchase from your private account, even though our account balance was more like 3 figures and not 7. We'll increase your overdraft limit until the GmbH gets registered. No problem.</p><p><span>So to this day I have a screenshot of electronic banking with an balance that day of minus one million Euros.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We thought that was pretty funny until we tried to buy groceries and our bank card got denied. We had to call the bank again to increase our limit a bit more so we could eat.</span></p>",
