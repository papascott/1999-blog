The server is synchronous and will call several publish callbacks at the same time. To reliably push to GitHub, I need to deal with the updated files asynchronously, one after the other. And since the publish callbacks run inside the server, I don't really want to do asynchronous things inside my publish callbacks, since I could then slow down or even block the server.</p><p>My idea now is just to save the updates someplace as json, then write a script running separately from nodeStorage to handle those updates one at a time. I'll do my best to give the json files unique filenames, using a timestamp with Date.now() and a md5 checksum of the body of the file being written. <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/papascott/32814997cf5e428085d7589388b7b71d\">Here is my script.</a></p><p>The next step will be a separate script to process those json files one at a time as they are produced.</p><p><br></p></div>\n\t\t<div class=\"divBlogPostWhen\"><a href=\"http://test-blog.papascott.de/2016/10/03/save1999ioUpdatesAsJsonToDealWithLater.html\">10/3/2016 at 1:33:21 PM by papascott</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"divBlogPost\" data-id=\"3\">\n\t\t<div class=\"divBlogPostTitle\"><a href=\"http://test-blog.papascott.de/2016/09/16/push1999ioToGithub.html\">Copy 1999.io files to GitHub 2</a></div>\n\t\t<div class=\"divBlogPostBody\"><p>This didn't actually turn out the way I planned when I was <a href=\"http://1999.papascott.de/2016/09/13/settingUpForGithub.html\">setting everything up for GitHub</a>â€¦</p><p>I thought that using git from a callback would be just like using it when I'm using it to save code. Do 'git status' to see what needs to be done, 'git add' to set up what to commit, 'git commit' to save to the local repository, and finally 'git push' to send the changes to GitHub.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the simple-git module is included with nodeStorage, it can be simply loaded into our callback.

When I actually put it in a callback, I sometimes get errors when trying to push. The reason is when updating a post, the callback is called on 5 different files simultaneously. That's no problem when just writing files, but when they all try to push to GitHub over the network at the same time, some of them will fail.</p><p>I wasn't sure how to get the callbacks to keep track of what the others were doing, and for the time being I came up with a kludge. I only run the simpleGit commands for rss.xml (which gets written on every update), and using setTimeout I wait 5 seconds before doing so (since all the callbacks seems to complete in about 1 second, 5 seconds should be long enough for them to complete). My script is saved as a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/papascott/03f48a0bb553619f2f74789716e857b2\">gist</a>.</p><p>It's a interim solution, a kludge, it works well enough for my purposes, but I wouldn't recommend it for anybody else. However, GitHub does have an API where you can take actions without a local repository. Maybe that will work better?
