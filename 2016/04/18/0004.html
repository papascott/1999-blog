Then we get out the ant spray, secure the entry, and wait a few days see if they find a new entry and come back.They usually don't. The spring weather gets warmer, and I presume the ants then find it easier to find their food outside rather than risk encountering ant spray inside. But they have the knowledge of how to get into our kitchen, and their offspring will use that knowledge next year, to find a new entry.Here is this year's point of entry, and our weapon of choice.
