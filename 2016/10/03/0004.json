But they didn't. I was having the same problems over the API as when using simpleGit locally.</p><p>The problem, I think, is the same as before, and is similar to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/09/27/whatILearnedAboutFswritefileToday.html\">the problems with fs.writeFile</a> that Dave described last week. The server is synchronous and will call several publish callbacks at the same time. To reliably push to GitHub, I need to deal with the updated files asynchronously, one after the other. And since the publish callbacks run inside the server, I don't really want to do asynchronous things inside my publish callbacks, since I could then slow down or even block the server.</p><p>My idea now is just to save the updates someplace as json, then write a script running separately from nodeStorage to handle those updates one at a time. I'll do my best to give the json files unique filenames, using a timestamp with Date.now() and the md5 checksum of the body of the file being written. <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/papascott/32814997cf5e428085d7589388b7b71d\">Here is my script.</a></p><p>The next step will be a separate script to process those json files one at a time as they are produced.</p><p><br></p>",
