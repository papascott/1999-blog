When I actually put it in a callback, I sometimes get errors when trying to push. The reason is when updating a post, the callback is called on 5 different files simultaneously. That's no problem when just writing files, but when they all try to push to GitHub over the network at the same time, some of them will fail.</p><p></p>",
