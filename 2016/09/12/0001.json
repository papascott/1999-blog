Before I was using the domain <span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"http://1999.papascott.de\">1999.papascott.de</span>&nbsp;to stage articles for my main blog. But now I've decided to start over and keep 1999 as a separate blog.&nbsp;</p>Resetting (clearing the home page and reverting the menus and templates) was pretty easy. Under publicFiles/users/papascott:&nbsp;<div><ul><li>delete chatLog.json</li><li>delete the folder misc and everything in it</li><li>restart the server</li></ul><p>Now I've got a clean slate to post little tech notes like this one. :-) The previous pages are still there just in case anyone is linking to them.</p></div>",
